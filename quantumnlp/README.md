The Quantum NLP project in the NLP Lab is currently a reading group focusing on the most recent papers in Quantum NLP. Our goal is to familiarize everybody with the different tools and environments for QNLP.

The reading group meets independently of the NLP Lab weekly meeting at [IU-B](https://www.indiana.edu/). If you want to join this meeting, contact [Damir Cavar] directly.


The papers we are reading are:

- Coecke et al. (2010) [Mathematical Foundations for a Compositional Distributional Model of Meaning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1003.4394).
- Kartasaklis et al. (2021) [lambeq: An Efficient High-Level Python Library for Quantum NLP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.04236).
- Widdows et al. (2022) [Near-Term Advances in Quantum Natural Language Processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.02171).
- Alexander and Widdows (2023) [Quantum Text Encoding for Classification Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.03715).
- Lorenz et al. (2021) [QNLP in Practice: Running Compositional Models of Meaning on a Quantum Computer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.12846).
- Meichanetzidis et al. (2020) [Grammar-aware sentence classification on quantum computers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.03756).
