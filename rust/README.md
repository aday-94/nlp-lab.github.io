## NLP-Lab Rust Info and Links

(C) 2022 by [Damir Cavar], [NLP-Lab]

There are many reasons why we favor [Rust] for some implementations and components, in particular when it comes to Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications. We might eleborate on that in some future documents.

Here are some links to relevant [Rust] pages:

- [Rust Language](https://www.rust-lang.org/) - Main website
- [The Rust Language Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)
- [Rust-Edu](https://rust-edu.org/) - Rust education in academia (and beyond)
- [Oxigraph](https://github.com/oxigraph/) - Rust-based RDF and SPARQL enabled graph database


Our local work in progress focusing on NLP and AI tools and environments for Rust:

- [Rust tutorial notebooks](https://github.com/dcavar/rust-tutorial-notebooks) - work in progress


If you are interested in joining our [Rust] tutorials with a focus on using [Rust] for [NLP] and [AI] or in Robotics environments (with the [Robot Operating System] ([ROS])), please get in touch!
