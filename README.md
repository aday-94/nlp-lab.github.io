## Welcome to The NLP Lab Pages

The Natural Language Processing Lab (NLP-Lab) has a simple motto:

*You cannot train yourself a car. You cannot machine-learn a tire for it. You have to engineer it.*

We do train models, but we actually build and engineer systems. If we know something about language in general or a language in particular, we enjoy using this knowledge in engineering of NLP and AI technologies. Our NLP and AI focus is on computational semantics, reasoning, common sense, and knowledge representations and processing.


The NLP Lab is located at [Indiana University Bloomington](https://indiana.edu/). We meet 3 times a week on campus at [IU Bloomington](https://indiana.edu/). The current meeting location is Ballantine Hall 5th floor. See the map link below.

## Focus

During the 2020 semester the focus is on:

- [Antisemitism in Social Media](/antisemitism)
- [Language Resources for Turkic Languages](/turkic) - [Focusing on Azerbaijani](/turkic)
- [Knowledge Graph extraction and visualization from relational databases, unstructured text, and images/videos](/kgextraction)
- Entailment and Reasoning over Knowledge Graphs (and Description Logic).
- Processing of the Mueller Report: corpus analysis, prediction models, Knowledge Graph and Event Graph extraction, time reference and sequencing along time axis ([GitHub repo](https://github.com/SemiringInc/Mueller-Report-Corpus)). The cleaned out text corpus with basic annotations is finally available. More data coming soon.

We are organizing special meetings to refresh our knowledge of Lisp and Prolog for logic computation and reasoning, in particular related to computational semantics and pragmatics, and probabilistic logic.
